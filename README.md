# Shoes_RMRS_Scraping


## Overview of the Project

RMRS is a local running store that has an online shop and catalogue of shoes for purchase.

This project uses the Splinter to automate a web browser and access the data on each page of the mens footwear
collection. The browser iterates through each page of the collection and uses HTML tags to access each shoe 
as well as it's product name and price. As a preliminary step each shoe type and price are stored as strings in 
lists. Additional work will be conducted at a later date to store these values in a format for analysis.
